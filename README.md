# typr.
typr. is a minimalistic typing test website, inspired by monkeytype.com. The typing test allows you to see what you are currently typing and the words that need to be typed in a compact interface. It also provides you the choice on how long you want to do the test.

	- The caret smoothly follows the input of the user, seamlessly simulating how a caret should be.
